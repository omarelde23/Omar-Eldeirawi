Omar Eldeirawi
Software Development Engineer in Test (SDET)

Analytical and impact-oriented SDET with 5 years of experience designing, developing, and maintaining automated test frameworks to ensure high-quality software delivery. Adept at bridging the gap between QA and development through robust automation, data-driven strategies, and strong CI/CD practices.

My focus is on reducing test cycle time and boosting automation stability across multi-component systems, using modern tools like Playwright and Cypress.

🚀 Technical HighlightsS: Framework Design: Reduced test cycle time from 3 days to 1 day and increased regression coverage by 50% across multiple projects. 
Data Validation: Wrote complex SQL queries to validate backend data accuracy against front-end UI behavior during integration testing. 
CI/CD & Stability: Improved deployment speed and reliability by implementing tailored scripts and advanced trace logging, boosting stability across environments.
API Testing; Built and maintained API test suites to validate endpoints for user management, reporting, and critical data flow integrity.
Methodologies: Engineered secure user authentication flows, enhancing test coverage by 60% and reducing critical security vulnerabilities.


🧪 Key Projects & Experience:
1. Visualizer App (Floor & Decor): Developed and maintained automated UI and E2E tests for the customer-facing Visualizer application, ensuring a seamless experience for visualizing products in user-uploaded spaces. Contribution: Built a scalable Playwright framework supporting over 150 automated scenarios, resulting in a 50% reduction in manual testing effort.

2. Internal Employee Portal (Purple Drive Technologies): Designed and executed regression suites for an internal employee hub covering HR, payroll, and internal updates.
Contribution: Cut overall test cycle time by 30% through optimized, data-driven Cypress automation. Designed reusable, modular test utilities, reducing automation maintenance efforts by 40%.

3. Integration & Data Flow Reliability: Ensuring data consistency across the front-end application and backend systems.
Contribution: Wrote and optimized complex SQL queries to validate data integrity. Conducted thorough integration testing to ensure data accuracy and system reliability between all layers.
